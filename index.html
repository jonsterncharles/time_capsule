 <!-- Buried Audio Project is a curated archive of obscure and niche podcasts that we feel give a nuanced perspective into the lives of those in 2019. These 15 podcasts consist of a broad range of specific interests including (but not limited to) dungeons and dragons commentary, business tips from a private investigator, true crime stories from the Great Lakes, and self-described weather junkies. By looking through the eyes of the individual, we believe that we can give insight into their lives as well as a testament to the highly personalized content that has become trademark to the internet leading up to 2019.
We aimed to keep our code concise and efficient so there would be no issues when comes to legacy and accessibility. Javascript was kept to a minimum in case there are any drastic changes to the language in 10 years, and the majority of the interactions on the page are css based since that language has proved to be very stable and trustworthy. All images were given alt tags in case the photos were lost somehow and also to provide convenience for all types of users.
As a collaboration we found that communication and empathy was key in completing our project. We all come from different backgrounds, whether that’s design, coding, photography, or art we managed to find a dynamic that served all four of our skill sets. By communicating frequently over slack, and meeting twice a week we kept our obligations up to date and were able to ask for help and provide assistance to each other when needed. -->

      This project will be buried 4/17/2019. As of February 2018, there are approximately 660,000 running podcast shows with a total of 28 million indi-vidual episodes. Thats a lot of audio. Who knows what that number will be 10 years from now? (well, you do, the person who found this website, but we don’t).
      <br>
      <br>
       Podcasting gets the short end of the stick when treated like a disposable medium. Many podcasts are forgotten shortly after they’re published. And a lot of podcasts are never listened too. Maybe those shows are about something way too specific. Maybe those shows are way too generic. Maybe their creators abandon the project 4 episodes in because turns out they’re not as emotionally invested in their cereal review show as they thought they were gonna be. Or most likely of all, the creators just forget about it themselves.
       <br>
      <br>
       We view them differently. These recordings were someone's passion project! These recordings were personal to someone at some point. Someone got together with their friends and invested a lot of energy into trying to share their passion for something with the world; regardless of how relatable that passion may have been.  A lot of these shows have hundreds of hours worth of episodes, episodes that only a handful of people listened to.
       <br>
    <br>
    Our goal is to preserve those episodes in hopes that one day, when this gem of a time capsule is opened, they will be heard by anybody who cares. We have included in this collection our own podcast, reflecting our views on this project, the time period we live in, and a statement about our own lives. Podcasts become available April 17, 2029 at 3:00 PM.
